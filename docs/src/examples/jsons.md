# Processing JSONs

Processing JSONs is actually one of the main motivations for building `Mill.jl`. As a matter of fact, with `Mill.jl` one is now able to process any set of valid JSON documents that follow the same meta schema. [`JsonGrinder.jl`](https://github.com/pevnak/JsonGrinder.jl) is a library that helps with infering the schema and other steps in the pipeline. For some examples, please refer to its documentation [`JsonGrinder.jl`](https://pevnak.github.io/JsonGrinder.jl/stable).
