`Mill.jl` is a library built on top of [`Flux.jl`](https://fluxml.ai) aimed to flexibly prototype *hierarchical multi-instance learning* models as described in [Pevny2018a](@cite) and  [Pevny2018b](@cite). It is developed to be:

* **flexible** and **versatile**
* as **general** as possible
* **fast** 
* and dependent on only handful of other packages
