# Missing values

At the moment, Mill.jl features an initial and naive approach to missing values. We assume that `ArrayNode` have missing values replaced by zeros, which is not optimal but in many situations it works reasonably well.

BagNodes with missing features are indicated by Bags being set to `[0:-1]` with `missing` as a data and metadata. This can be seamlessly concatenated or sub-set, if the operation makes sense.

Couple examples from unit tests. Let's define full and empty BagNode
```
julia> a = BagNode(ArrayNode(rand(3,4)),[1:4], nothing)
BagNode with 1 bag(s)
  └── ArrayNode(3, 4)

julia> e = BagNode(missing, AlignedBags([0:-1]), nothing)
BagNode with 1 empty bag(s)
```

We can concatenate them as follows.
```
julia> x = reduce(catobs,[a, e])
BagNode with 2 bag(s)
  └── ArrayNode(3, 4)
```
Notice, that the ArrayNode has still the same dimension as ArrayNode of just `a`. The missing second element, corresponding to `e` is indicated by the second bags being `0:-1` as follows:
```
julia> x.bags
AlignedBags(UnitRange{Int64}[1:4, 0:-1])
```

We can get back the missing second element as
```
julia> x[2]
BagNode with 1 empty bag(s)
```

During forward (and backward) pass, the missing values in BagNodes are filled in aggregation by zeros. ** In order this feature to work, the `Aggregation` needs to know dimension, therefore use MissingAggregation, which can handle this.** In the future, MissingAggregation will be made default.

Last but not least,
`TreeNodes` cannot handle missing values, as the missingness is propagated to its leaves, i.e.
```
julia> TreeNode((a,e))
TreeNode{2}
  ├── BagNode with 1 bag(s)
  │     └── ArrayNode(3, 4)
  └── BagNode with 1 empty bag(s)
```
