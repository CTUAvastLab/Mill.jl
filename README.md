# Mill


Mill is a library to implement flexible multi-instance learning models as described in *Discriminative models for multi-instance problems with tree-structure, Tomas Pevny, Petr Somol, 2016* https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02868 and *Using Neural Network Formalism to Solve Multiple-Instance Problems, Tomas Pevny, Petr Somol, 2016*. An example of how to use the library on simple MUSK problem is in example directory.
